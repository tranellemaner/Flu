This past year’s strain of flu was severe not only for the general public but more so for children than any other year in the past. The number of pediatric deaths reached a new high of 179 as of August 2018.</h3>

For both the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons the ACIP recommended that LAIV4 or Live attenuated influenza vaccine not be distributed because of efficacy. The ACIP analyzed data from 2010-11 through 2016-17 and found that children were the least protected without this vaccination method. </h3>

    <div class="small">
      <h3>According to ControlFlu.com during 2016-17, the first year when the FluMist was not available, there was a 41% decrease in the overall vaccination rate across public schools. It’s possible that the decrease in the vaccination number led to more students contracting the disease; however, there is no concrete data record of children who contract the flu. </h3>
